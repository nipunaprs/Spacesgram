# Spacestagram 
##Space-Themed Social Media Brought To You By NASA APOD API

This project was created for the 2022 Shopify Intern Challenge! You can view a live deployment of the project here (https://spacestagrams.netlify.app/).' 

Video Breakdown of the project is available here (https://youtu.be/LcuwUZDjF4k).

It is coded in React and regular CSS without any external UI packs. This uses the NASA APOD API (https://api.nasa.gov/) to load images daily that are related to space. Users can like/unlike images, filter based on certain dates, and view images as far back as the 90's!
